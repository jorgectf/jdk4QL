Visit [the Actions page](https://github.com/jorgectf/jdk4QL/actions), click on the latest workflow and download the artifacts. You may need to unzip the downloaded artifact from the GitHub UI before using it with CodeQL as per a known double-zip [issue](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/issues/39).
